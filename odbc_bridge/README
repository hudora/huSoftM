The ODBC_bridge is used to bridge between Python/HTTP and IBM iSeries/AS400 ODBC.
It is part of huSoftM.

See https://cybernetics.hudora.biz/intern/wordpress/2008/12/eine-http-odbc-bridge-in-erlang/
for further explanation.

To compile you need at least Erlang 12B-4 installed. Erlang needs to be installed with ODBC-Extensions.
It also needs the IBM iSeries Access Toolkit for Linux installed and configured to get ODBC connectivity.

This code contains mochiweb r87 by Mochimedia and fragments of yaws by Claes Wikstrom.
See http://code.google.com/p/mochiweb/ and http://yaws.hyber.org/#.

To use:

$ cd odbc_bridge
$ (cd deps/mochiweb-src/ ; make)
$ make
$ sh start.sh
$ python support/test.py 
$ cat log/access.log 

Done!
